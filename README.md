# Continuous-Build-and-Integration-System
OCD document

In this Continuous-Build-and-Integration-System document I have explained how to 
process and store large amount of source code files publicly and privately. 

I have also explained how CBIS is used in multi-development project where 
different development groups work on different parts of the project and 
these parts are continuously integrated as the project develops.
